# Introduction

**Flutter** is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features. Flutter works on the basic idea of object oriented programing.


This is an implementation of an mobile app  that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.
